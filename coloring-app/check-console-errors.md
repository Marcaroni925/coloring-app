# Browser Console Error Check

## How to Check for JavaScript Errors:

1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:5173
2. **Right-click** anywhere on the white page
3. **Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"**
4. **Click the "Console" tab**
5. **Look for any red error messages**

## Common Error Types:

### Import/Export Errors:
- "Failed to resolve module"
- "Cannot resolve dependency"
- "Unexpected token 'export'"

### Firebase Errors:
- "Firebase config error"
- "Auth domain not authorized"

### React Errors:

- "Component not defined"

## What to Do:

1. Copy any error messages you see
2. Take a screenshot if needed
3. Share the errors so we can fix them

The white screen means the server is working but JavaScript is failing to load or execute properly.
