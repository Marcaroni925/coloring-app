# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Coloring Book Creator App

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Author**: Grok (as Project Manager/Planner)  
**Status**: Draft – Ready for Review  
**Overview**: This PRD outlines the requirements for "Coloring Book Creator," an AI-powered web app (with future mobile extensions) that generates customizable, printable black-and-white line art coloring book pages. It draws from user discussions, UI mockups, competitor analysis, and research on clean/beautiful/functional designs. The goal is to provide a stress-relief tool for adults (parents, teachers, hobbyists) that's intuitive for teens/kids, with seamless prompt refinement for "perfect" outputs on the first try.

## 1. Product Overview
### 1.1 Purpose and Goals
- **Problem Solved**: Existing coloring book apps (e.g., ColorBliss, DZINE.AI, ColoringBook.ai) lack deep customization, consistent AI outputs, and immersive theming, leading to frustrating regenerations and generic designs. Users want on-demand, family-friendly line art for printing and hand-coloring.
- **Value Proposition**: An easy-to-use app that refines user inputs into optimized prompts for OpenAI's DALL-E, generating high-quality 300 DPI PDFs. Improves on competitors with required customizations (no defaults), bulk gallery actions, and a playful UI (doodle borders, pastels, crayon animations).
- **Key Objectives**:
  - MVP: Functional web app with prompt form, AI generation, preview, download/save.
  - Long-Term: Community sharing, physical book creation (e.g., Printful integration).
- **Success Metrics**:
  - MVP Done: Dev server runs flawlessly (`npm start`), generates images <10s, UI looks beautiful (themed with animations), all features work (e.g., validation, gallery delete).
  - KPIs: 90% prompt success rate (consistent B&W outputs), user satisfaction (e.g., Net Promoter Score >8 from test users), low error rate (<5% API failures).
- **Scope Exclusions**: No digital coloring in-app (focus on printable outputs); no offline/PWA; no photo-to-line-art (post-MVP).

## 2. Target Audience and User Personas
- **Primary Users**: Adults (25-55): Parents generating kid activities, teachers for educational pages, hobbyists for mandalas/stress relief.
- **Secondary Users**: Teens/kids (usable interface, but accounts/payments require adults for safety/compliance).
- **User Personas**:
  - **Persona 1: Busy Parent (Sarah, 35)**: Needs quick, family-friendly pages; values simple form, validation, and PDF downloads.
  - **Persona 2: Hobbyist Artist (Alex, 42)**: Seeks detailed customizations (e.g., thick lines for mandalas); appreciates themed UI and gallery for saving creations.
  - **Persona 3: Teacher (Jordan, 28)**: Wants age-appropriate options (kids/teens); bulk save/delete for class prep.

## 3. User Stories and Use Cases
- **As a user, I want to enter a description and select a theme so I can generate personalized pages.** (Text box required; theme dropdown optional.)
- **As a user, I want required customizations with validation so my image matches my intent without defaults.** (Select detail, age, border, thickness; errors if skipped.)
- **As a user, I want AI to refine my prompt perfectly so I get ideal B&W line art on the first try.** (No retry; neutral assumptions if options skipped.)
- **As a user, I want a zoomable preview and options to download PDF or save to gallery after generation.** (300 DPI PDF; modal for actions.)
- **As a logged-in user, I want to view/save/delete images in my gallery (single or bulk).** (Bulk via checkboxes + delete button; confirm dialog.)
- **As a user, I want Google/Apple/email login for seamless access across devices.** (Age note for payments.)
- **Use Case Flow**: Open app > Login (optional for generation) > Fill form (validation prevents submit) > Generate (spinner) > Preview loads (fade-in) > Modal: Download/Save > Gallery view (grid with delete options).

## 4. Functional Requirements
- **Core Features**:
  - Prompt Input: Required textarea; optional theme dropdown.
  - Customization: Radio/dropdown/checkbox for detail/age/border/thickness; real-time validation (red errors, green checks).
  - AI Refinement/Generation: Backend OpenAI call (mock key for testing); refined prompt ensures B&W, family-friendly, 300 DPI.
  - Preview: Zoomable (pinch/scroll); post-gen modal with buttons.
  - Download: PDF export (300 DPI).
  - Gallery: Save/retrieve/delete (single/bulk with checkboxes); image grid thumbnails.
- **Non-Functional**:
  - Performance: Generation <10s; animations lightweight (e.g., crayon effect with fallbacks).
  - Security: Family-friendly filters; Firebase auth.
  - Accessibility: ARIA labels, high-contrast toggle, keyboard nav (WCAG 2.1 compliant).
  - Responsiveness: Mobile-first (stack vertically <768px).

## 5. UI/UX Guidelines
- **Design Principles**: Clean minimalism with playful theming—pastel palette (#FFE6E6 accents, #A7C7E7 buttons), Handlee font for headings, doodle borders (wavy dashed #CCC), subtle animations (e.g., crayon-drawing effect on load: CSS stroke-dashoffset with wobble, 1-2s duration, performance fallbacks via prefers-reduced-motion).
- **Wireframe Specs**: Header (fixed 60px, icon left, toggle right); centered form card (rounded 16px, padding 20px); accordion for customizations; generate button (centered, hover scale); preview (min-height 400px); modal z-index 50.
- **Mockup References**: Based on generated images—desktop two-column, mobile vertical stack; tooltips for refined prompt; green checks on validation.

## 6. Technical Specifications
- **Tech Stack**: React (frontend, Tailwind CSS), Node.js/Express (backend), OpenAI (DALL-E with mock key), Firebase (auth/gallery).
- **Dependencies**: npm install tailwindcss, openai, firebase, etc.
- **Integrations**: Mock API for testing; Google/Apple auth via Firebase.
- **Constraints**: No offline; web-first, React Native for mobile later.

## 7. Success Metrics and Risks
- **Metrics**: 95% user completion rate (form to generation); <5% error rate; UI satisfaction (e.g., "great" from tests).
- **Risks & Mitigations**:
  - AI Inconsistency: Prompt refinement with filters; mock testing.
  - Performance Lag: Optimize animations (will-change CSS); Puppeteer tests for mobile.
  - Costs: Free tiers/mock keys for MVP.
  - Security: Firebase rules for gallery.

## 8. Timeline and Milestones
- **MVP Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (UI week 1, backend week 2, integration/testing week 3-4, deployment week 5-6).
- **Post-MVP**: Community features (month 2+).
